# Lesson-6
Concatenation: message = name + '(' + code_name + ')Teaches Math' creates a string by combining the name, code_name, and the text "Teaches Math" using + for concatenation.
Formatted String (f-string): message_1 = f'{name}({code_name})Teaches Math' does the same thing as the first line but more efficiently using an f-string, where variables are directly embedded inside curly braces {}.
